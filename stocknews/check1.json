{"body": "After a poor December quarter, earnings downgrades continue. \n\t\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t\tThe main culprits are public sector banks and commodity producers, but there are enough of them to pull down Nifty 50 estimates.Where there was great hope for an FY16 earnings rebound earlier in the year, now profits of Nifty firms are estimated to decline marginally. This naturally means that earnings growth estimates for FY17 will start looking bullish as the base (FY16 earnings) becomes smaller. Indeed, brokerage firms\u2019 estimates for earnings growth in FY17 range between 14% and 21%. But as the table shows, even these estimates have been chopped continuously as the economy is still struggling on the ground, there is no real demand revival and deflation persists. Aggregate FY17 earnings estimates for Nifty 50 firms have been cut by 10.4% over the past six months, according to Investec Capital Services (India) Pvt. Ltd. This carnage has been widespread. Four out of five Nifty companies saw an earnings downgrade in the December quarter. Energy companies and financial institutions were the worst hit; the pace of downgrades has also accelerated in these industries, as the table shows.If that is not bad enough, many public sector banks have postponed recognition of some bad assets to the March quarter. Exports haven\u2019t picked up and if the Union budget doesn\u2019t have some concrete steps to boost rural spending and increase capital expenditure, there won\u2019t be much succour for earnings over the next two-three quarters.Brokerage firms such as Investec Research expect another 10% downgrade in the FY17 earnings estimates for Nifty 50 companies. In that case, the fall in the markets might not be all that steep when viewed through the lens of fundamentals."},
{"body": "Fertilizer stocks are back in the limelight. They gained in Monday\u2019s trade on speculation that the government\u2019s rural focus may help solve the sector\u2019s problems.\n\t\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t\tThe primary issue afflicting the industry\u2019s growth is urea price control. The government makes good the production cost through subsidy, but unfortunately payments happen after long delays. Also under-allocation for subsidy requirement in earlier years means the budgeted amounts get exhausted in the first three quarters of the fiscal year.For instance, agricultural inputs manufacturer Coromandel International Ltd has received subsidy payment only till September. As of December, it has subsidy outstanding of <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>1,582 crore, payment of which may happen only in the next fiscal year.The delay in payments is keeping the interest costs at elevated levels. Data compiled by rating agency Icra Ltd shows that interest expenses of 11 listed companies in the industry more than doubled in the last four years (between 2010-11 and 2014-15). During the period, key return ratios of these companies, such as return on capital employed and return on net worth, roughly halved.Pooling of natural gas and the recent softening of the spot market rates have helped alleviate working capital pressure. As a result, barring a few companies like Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd and Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd, interest costs at most companies did not rise significantly so far this fiscal year.But that provides no comfort. Prices of raw materials and fertilizers have fallen significantly in international markets, offering scope for subsidy cuts. Analysts expect the government to use this window to retain the overall subsidy amount at current levels and route the cost savings (on NPK grade or complex fertilizers) to clear pending subsidies. NPK is short for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.This will not help the industry as it will widen the price gap between complex fertilizers and urea. The ideal step will be to rationalize urea prices, which will encourage balanced usage of fertilizers. But will the government bite the bullet? \u201cThere is a pricing anomaly in the market with urea price being highly subsidized, leading to indiscriminate usage at the cost of NPK fertilizers,\u201d K. Ravichandran, senior vice-president and co-head-corporate sector ratings at Icra, said. \u201cWhile the government may resort to reduction in per unit subsidy on NPK nutrients in order to contain subsidy, farm gate price increase on urea remains to be seen with elections round the corner in five states,\u201d he added."},
{"body": "An investment recovery and the health of the banking system are inextricably linked. The banking industry needs cash. Bloated with bad loans, state-owned banks require <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>1 trillion in the near term, estimate brokerage firms and rating agencies. The government, on the other hand, has allotted only <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>25,000 crore for this year under its so-called Indradhanush programme.\n\t\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t\tConsider this statistic: In the December quarter alone, banks posted a cumulative loss of <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>10,911 crore, which is slightly over two-fifths of government\u2019s proposed capital infusion. Credit Suisse estimates that unprovided problem loans are now at 65-200% of public sector banks\u2019 capital.The capital requirement will grow further as most banks are yet to recognize some more bad loans. The chart shows how badly banks need capital. Overall, estimated capital requirement for the banking system is between <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>2.5 trillion and <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>3 trillion over the next four years compared with the government\u2019s promise of <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>70,000 crore.Clearly, given its fiscal constraints the government may not be able to cough up any huge amount upfront, especially after the Seventh Pay Commission and 14th Finance Commission recommendations. The solution to the bad loan problem, which will free up cash for banks and enable them to accumulate it out of profits, lies in policy measures.A comprehensive bankruptcy code was promised in the last budget; it is in the works and yet to become law. Another idea that has taken hold in recent times is the creation of a \u201cbad bank\u201d, some version of the US\u2019s Troubled Asset Relief Programme after the 2008 crisis. This would be a sovereign-backed asset reconstruction company. But that doesn\u2019t save taxpayers from taking a hit as someone would have to make good those losses. It also creates a moral hazard as banks aren\u2019t made liable for their past bad decisions.Of course, the government can reduce its stake below 51% in public sector banks. It can always bring down its stake to 33% while still keeping voting rights intact. The big concern here is cheap valuations currently and hurdles from bank unions and accusations of selling the family silver. That would be the first step in injecting some much-required capital."},
{"body": "Investors will require more than one good quarter from GAIL (India) Ltd to alter their view on the stock, partly because the stock has gone up by almost a fourth in the last three months. \n\t\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t\tOne reason for this outperformance is the renegotiation of Qatar\u2019s RasGas liquefied natural gas (LNG) contract announced at the end of December, which is expected to reduce input costs in GAIL\u2019s petrochemicals business. But with petrochemical prices coming down, one will have to see whether the segment\u2019s profit improves meaningfully.For the December quarter, the loss before interest and tax for the petrochemicals business dropped to <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>161 crore from <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>237 crore seen in the September quarter. The performance could have been better if it were not for stabilization issues faced at the new petrochemicals plant. As Jefferies Equity Research notes, given management commentary that GAIL almost entirely used spot LNG in the third quarter versus mainly RasGas in the second quarter (which was costlier), earnings improvement in petrochemicals was below par.Nevertheless, GAIL\u2019s overall results did beat expectations. Its gas trading business exceeded expectations, reporting earnings before interest and tax of <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>483 crore against <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>51 crore for the year-ago period and <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>193 crore in the September quarter. Gas pooling for the power sector fetched additional trading volumes sequentially. The company\u2019s transmission business too performed well.The upshot: net profit increased 10% year-on-year to <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>664 crore despite a 10% decline in revenues. Strong other income growth helped.What next? Gas volumes can go up once the increased LNG supplies from RasGas start and once power pooling is implemented in certain states like Andhra Pradesh (still pending due to taxation issues), point out JM Financial analysts.Currently, GAIL trades at 12.5 times estimated earnings for the next fiscal year. Given the rally in the stock over the last three months, most catalysts such as higher crude oil price, positive impact of lower gas price, transmission tariff revision and pickup in transmission volumes seem to be priced in, says Jefferies."},

{"body": "Reacting to the railway budget, one industry stakeholder told a business news channel that he was happy with the announcements as long as he didn\u2019t think about how they would be funded. That aptly sums up the mood on the Street, which dumped railway-related stocks after the budget was presented.The highlight, of course, is the scaling up of capital expenditure (capex) to <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>1.2 trillion for the next fiscal year, which is entirely commendable. But believing the big numbers requires a leap of faith.First, the targets set for the current fiscal year are seeing sharp cuts. Capex for the current year has been revised down from around <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>1 trillion to <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>82,192 crore. To be sure, that\u2019s far higher than what the railways has been clocking for years. But as of December, the national transporter spent only 64% of the revised capex target, an increase of less than one-fourth from the year-ago period.The second problem is resource generation. After meeting all expenditure, Indian Railways is estimated to generate net revenue of <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>18,210 crore in the next fiscal year. It is not only 8% less than the current fiscal year\u2019s revised estimate (which itself has been cut) but is also prone to serious downward revisions.Total traffic receipts (both from freight and passenger fares) are estimated to rise 10%, optimistic considering the lack of upward revision of tariffs. As in the previous budget, the ministry is projecting a double-digit (12%) growth in passenger earnings, when the number of passengers is actually declining. The expected fall is 1.5% in the current fiscal year. This year, passenger revenue is expected to go up by 7%. True, freight revenue growth projections are realistic at 5%. But lack of time-bound measures to revive the flagging volumes\u2014estimated to grow just 1% in the current fiscal year\u2014has been a disappointment.Of course, a significant part of the Plan expenditure is funded by support from the Union budget, borrowings and institutional finance. But as Religare Capital Markets Ltd points out, resources from all these sources have fallen short of budget estimates. If economic activity does not see a meaningful recovery and the government\u2019s fiscal position remains stretched, then it is likely the budgetary support for next fiscal year will also be constrained.The railways plans to further lower costs and boost non-traffic revenue. While the ministry has achieved some success in cost-control measures, non-traffic revenue is showing no signs of improvement yet\u2014in fact, it is expected to fall 8% this year.All this gives way to some doubts about the budget estimates. \u201cThe poor performance in FY16 has few excuses, unless the projections for FY16 were too ambitious to begin with,\u201d Religare Capital Markets wrote in a note. \u201cOne cannot help but be sceptical of FY17 projections, therefore, especially on the funding part of the planned expenditure.\u201dHowever, there is no denying that the railways\u2019 capex is growing. As Dilip Bhat, joint managing director at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd, points out, even if the railways manages to achieve capex of <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>1 trillion next fiscal year, it will be a significant improvement from the <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>40,000-60,000 crore the organization was spending some years back.While that is a clear indication of the government\u2019s push to kick-start growth through increased public investments, the fact remains that the numbers need to be taken with a pinch of salt."},
{"body": "Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd\u2019s (M&amp;M\u2019s) December quarter performance has gone down well with investors. The diversified auto manufacturer, facing growth challenges in both farm equipment and auto segments, managed to sustain profitability on the back of decent sales growth. The stock therefore rose 5% on Monday but slipped a bit on Tuesday, even as it has outperformed the BSE Auto index in the last one year.\n\t\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t\tFuelling growth were the nine new launches in the auto segment through fiscal year 2016 that pushed up sales by about 15% from a year ago. And the price hike helped to improve the average per vehicle revenue by about 4%. However, it was not so in the farm equipment segment, where volumes grew by only 5% year-on-year and the revenue per unit sold fell by 1.7%.True, a weak rabi crop after two consecutive weak monsoons has dried up demand for farm equipment. Yet, as the market leader in tractors, M&amp;M\u2019s market share rose by about 300 basis points to 43% during the quarter. Its small commercial vehicles did not do too well. A basis point is 0.01%.Put together, net revenue (M&amp;M and Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd) rose by 15%. But what enthused investors was the 250 basis points jump in operating margin, at a time when sales growth is not at its best. Analysts feel that one-offs impacted profitability. An Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd report says that provisioning in line with the new Bonus Act, value diminution of assets and revaluation of loans impacted profit margins for the quarter. Of course, the biggest relief was the lower raw material costs and efforts to trim vehicle inventory. But this is no reason for bullishness on the company\u2019s prospects. The forthcoming monsoon is critical in determining offtake of farm equipment and automobiles. M&amp;M\u2019s management has pulled down its guidance for the former in FY16 from \u20135% to \u201310% and this segment comprises a third of the consolidated revenue.That said, the year after may see a better growth rate given the low base, and support an expansion in valuation. At present, the M&amp;M stock trades at 10 times one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple. Given the estimated growth of 15% in annual earnings over the next two years, the stock does not seem expensive."},
{"body": "When spot prices are lower than that of contracted long-term prices, it is natural for consumers to be reluctant to make long-term purchases. That\u2019s what happened with Petronet LNG Ltd. Moreover, the anticipated revision of the RasGas, Qatar, contract led to further reduced offtake. \n\t\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t\tFor the December quarter, long-term volume was about 38 trillion British thermal units (trillion Btus), representing just two-fifths of the contracted volume. As a result of lower long-term volume, the firm had to bear ship idling charges worth about <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>85 crore in the quarter.Sure, short-term volume and volume from services (tolling) increased, and compensated for the lack of long-term volume. Still, capacity utilization fell. Petronet LNG\u2019s Dahej Terminal has operated at around 109% of its nameplate capacity for the December quarter against 120% for the September quarter. The volume regasified at Dahej Terminal last quarter was 138 trillion Btus compared with 154 trillion Btus for the September quarter. The Kochi Terminal handled only a nominal volume of liquefied natural gas (LNG), according to the company.The outcome: Petronet LNG reported results sharply below expectations. Operating and net profits declined 32% and 28%, respectively, against the September quarter to <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>316 crore and <span style=\" font-family: 'Utopia Std_Rupee'; ;\"><span class=\"WebRupee\">Rs.</span></span>178 crore, respectively.But investors need not lose sleep over this. While the Petronet LNG stock has declined 7% from its annual high in January, it has substantially outperformed broader markets so far this fiscal year. The company has renegotiated the RasGas contract in December-end and that removes a key risk. The worst then could be behind us. Long-term volume is likely to recover in the current quarter. Outlook on spot volume too is not bad. \u201cHuge liquefaction capacities coming up in Australia and US will keep spot LNG prices subdued, resulting in higher demand for spot volume,\u201d point out analysts from Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.The Petronet LNG stock trades at 16 times next year\u2019s earnings estimates, factoring in most of the positives. The firm maintains work for expansion of Dahej LNG Terminal from 10 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to 15 mtpa is on track. The capacity expansion is likely to be completed by year end. Delays on that will not go down well with investors. News flow on pipeline issues at the Kochi Terminal is something investors will have to follow closely."}
